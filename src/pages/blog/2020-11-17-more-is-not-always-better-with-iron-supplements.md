description: I’ve had a lot of people ask me about iron supplements lately, so I
  wanted to clear the air on why taking an iron supplement can be dangerous, and
  usually unnecessary unless you are anemic.

First off, no one should be taking an iron supplement unless their blood levels of iron have been measured by their doctor. There are a number of different lab tests that can measure iron status in the body, and usually your doctor will order an iron panel, B12 test, and a complete blood count to get a good picture of your iron stores. I won’t go into detail about all of these lab tests, but if you would like more information about anemia and its diagnosis, please check out this [link](https://www.hematology.org/education/patients/anemia/iron-deficiency).

**Side note:** There are many factors that can skew the result of your iron test such as certain supplements, receiving a recent blood transfusion, or having an infection. For more information on how to prepare for your blood test, check out these [recommendations](https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/medical-tests/hw41550#hw41586).

### **Reasons why taking a supplement without getting blood levels checked is dangerous:**

1. It may be masking a type of anemia unrelated to low dietary iron, or a serious health condition such as chronic blood loss (i.e. from heavy menstrual bleeding, peptic or intestinal ulcers, or pregnancy).
2. Iron supplements can cause digestive side effects such as constipation, nausea, and vomiting if not taken in a doctor recommended form or dose.
3. If you have hemochromatosis (a condition where your body can’t regulate iron absorption), taking iron supplements can cause organ failure. This condition is common in 1/250 people, so you should always check your blood levels prior to supplementation to be safe.
4. Having too much iron can cause oxidative damage to your cells, blood vessels, and organs, even if you don’t have hemochromatosis. Chronically high iron levels is associated with increased risk of cancer, heart, metabolic, and liver disease.

**Serum Ferritin**

Serum ferritin is one of the more common iron tests, and reflects the amount of total iron available in storage in the body. In most Canadian labs, the “healthy” reference range of serum ferritin is considered:

Men: 18-270 micrograms/Litre (mcg/L)

Women: 18-160 mcg/L

Children: 7-140 mcg/L

As you can see, the range for ferritin levels is quite wide in all age groups. Those that fall **under** the low end of this range are at risk of anemia. Doctors don’t usually question when ferritin levels fall on the higher end of the above spectrum, as long as it fits within the reference range. Yet new research is questioning if these reference ranges are ideal for optimal health, as having high ferritin levels is associated with many chronic diseases (more on this below). (1, 4, 10)

### **So if your blood levels are in the low end of the normal range, should you be taking an iron supplement?**

Although iron is necessary for many biological functions, it is also known to cause oxidative stress on tissues.(1) The current reference ranges use a bell curve approach and recommend the levels be relative to the population in the 50th-90th percentile of iron stores.(2) Yet research is showing that having iron stores in these ranges is associated with cardiovascular disease(3), type two diabetes(4), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease(5, 6), and cancer.(7, 8, 9) There are many clinical trials demonstrating that lowering ferritin levels through blood donation results in improvement of these conditions.(2, 7)

It is suggested that the optimal ferritin levels be at the low end of the reference range, closer to the 50th percentile (i.e. 18 mcg/L for adults and 7 mcg/L children).(2, 3) This obviously challenges the widely held belief that iron stores anywhere in the reference range should not cause concern, as being on the higher end of the spectrum may actually do more harm than good!

## Blood Donation:

Usually people donate blood for altruistic reasons, but the science is clearly showing that it has health benefits! Blood donation removes 450-500 mL per visit, and 3-4 donations per year is the common amount to reach the protective effects seen in studies.(2, 8) Donating blood will deplete your iron stores in the liver, spleen, and bone

marrow, and cause your body to regenerate new red blood cells. Of course there are risks for blood donation, including fainting, bruising, and hematomas, yet these are not very common. Of course you should talk to your doctor before considering blood donation, and should be avoided if you are anemic. But donating can be a great way to lower your iron levels to a healthier range, and prevent disease.

**Conclusion:**

Iron is a double edge sword. If you don’t get enough you have the negative impacts of anemia, but if you have too much, you have increased risk of metabolic disease, heart disease, and cancer. In North America, we often have the latter problem of too much iron through a high meat consuming diet, where our intake of iron exceeds the loss. Research is scrutinizing the currently wide reference ranges, as having iron stores at the lower end of the spectrum is more health protective. Always ask your doctor about checking your iron levels to see if you actually need supplementation, or if you should consider blood donation to lower your levels.
