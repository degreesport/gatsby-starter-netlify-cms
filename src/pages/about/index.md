![About Liz](/img/img_1240-3-2-1024x694.jpg "A Photo of Me")

In a nutshell, I’ve spend most of my academic career studying nutrition, with both an undergraduate degree and masters degree in Nutritional and Nutraceutical Sciences. I love nutrition, just as much as I love a good girls night with a glass of wine (I’m an *all about balance* kinda nutrition scientist). But what I love the most is helping others feel better.

I entered the world of naturopathic medicine two years ago, and my journey through med school has been life changing. Nutrition is a big foundation in naturopathic medicine, but I have now become so passionate about the many other modalities that naturopathic doctors utilize to treat the mind and body as one. The more I learn about medicine, the more my purpose fuels me to help as many people as I possibly can.

So yes I will say it again, I am so glad you found my site. I want this blog to be about helping YOU! With all the opposing information out there on nutrition and natural medicine, it can be hard to figure out who to trust. I am here to break down the research, show you the science, and share some new ideas that you can use to make small changes, to help you reach your best health!

As always, be well <3

P.S. just a disclosure, this website does not provide direct medical advice. I can lead you to some great options as far as naturopaths go, so if you are ever inquiring about working with an ND, shoot me a message on my contacts page with some details about what you are looking for and I’d be happy to help point you in the right direction.
